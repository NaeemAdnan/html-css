        <h3>Eassy about Cow</h3>
        <p>Cows, members of the Bovidae family, are domesticated herbivores known for their gentle nature. Commonly raised for milk, meat, and leather, these bovines feature distinctive humps and curved horns. With a calm temperament, they graze in pastures, contributing to rural landscapes. Beyond economic value, cows hold cultural and religious significance, symbolizing fertility and abundance in various traditions.</p>
